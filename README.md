This project hosts a compilation of my notes at the Write-Speak-Code conference (June 20th-22nd, 2013).

##Notes from the Op-Ed Project Training
http://www.theopedproject.org/

What if you knew the cure for cancer? Would you speak up?
- Yes, if the situation is about other helping people

###RESOURCE vs. EXPERT
- Resource: being helpful and useful to somebody
- Expert: a term of power

The risk with not speaking up when you're feeling insecure about not being the "expert" on a topic is selfishness. 

> "Because I don't know everything, nobody gets to know what I know."

###When writing an op-ed...
- Envision the likely outcome. 
Otherwise, it'd be difficult to achieve it. 
- You need an argument that is timely 
- Your argument needs to be evidence-based
- Your argument needs to be value-based (of public value)

sheetaluk@spotify.com came to speak to us about working at Spotify, and gave us advice, such as:
- practice
- do not be self-critical in an interview
- dont' be afraid to pursue
