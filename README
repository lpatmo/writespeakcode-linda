What if you knew the cure for cancer? Would you speak up?
- Yes, if the situation is about other helping people

RESOURCE vs. EXPERT
- Resource: being helpful and useful to somebody
- Expert: a term of power

The risk with not speaking up when you're feeling insecure about not being the "expert" on a topic is selfishness.
